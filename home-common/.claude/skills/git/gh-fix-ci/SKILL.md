description: Use when a user asks to debug or fix failing GitHub PR checks running in GitHub Actions.

Locate failing PR checks with `gh`, fetch the GitHub Actions logs, summarize the failure, then draft a fix in plan mode and implement only after explicit approval.

## Workflow

1. Verify gh authentication.
   - Run `gh auth status` in the repo.
   - If unauthenticated, ask the user to run `gh auth login` (ensuring repo + workflow scopes) before proceeding.
2. Resolve the PR.
   - Prefer the current branch PR: `gh pr view --json number,url`.
   - If the user provides a PR number or URL, use that directly.
3. Inspect failing checks (GitHub Actions only).
   - Preferred: run the bundled script (handles gh field drift and job-log fallbacks):
     - `python "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "<number-or-url>"`
     - Add `--json` for machine-friendly output.
   - Manual fallback:
     - `gh pr checks <pr> --json name,state,bucket,link,startedAt,completedAt,workflow`
       - If a field is rejected, rerun with the available fields reported by `gh`.
     - For each failing check, extract the run id from `detailsUrl` and run:
       - `gh run view <run_id> --json name,workflowName,conclusion,status,url,event,headBranch,headSha`
       - `gh run view <run_id> --log`
     - If the run log says it is still in progress, fetch job logs directly:
       - `gh api "/repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/jobs/<job_id>/logs" > "<path>"`
4. Scope non-GitHub Actions checks.
   - If `detailsUrl` is not a GitHub Actions run, label it as external and only report the URL.
   - Do not attempt Buildkite or other providers; keep the workflow lean.
5. Summarize failures for the user.
   - Provide the failing check name, run URL (if any), and a concise log snippet.
   - Call out missing logs explicitly.
6. Create a plan.
   - Enter plan mode to draft a concise plan and request approval.
7. Implement after approval.
   - Apply the approved plan, summarize diffs/tests, and ask about opening a PR.
8. Recheck status.
   - After changes, suggest re-running the relevant tests and `gh pr checks` to confirm.

## scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py

Fetches failing PR checks, pulls GitHub Actions logs, and extracts a failure snippet. Exits non-zero when failures remain, so it can gate automation.

Flags: `--repo` (path inside repo, default `.`), `--pr` (number or URL; defaults to the current-branch PR), `--json` (emit JSON instead of text), `--max-lines` / `--context` (tune snippet size).
